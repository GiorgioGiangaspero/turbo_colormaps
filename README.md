These are a small collection of Python scripts to generate colormap files for the [turbo colormap](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html) for [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org), [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov), and [GLVis](https://glvis.org).

The number of points in the colormap can be selected by changing the `npts` variable (or all 256 data points can be used).

Generated files for ParaView (`turbo.xml`) and VisIt (`turbo.ct`) are also provided.
